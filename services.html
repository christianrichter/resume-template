        <h3 class="resume-item-title" itemprop="name">Focus</h3>

        My focus is on building data pipelines on managed AWS infrastructure covering a broad range of data engineering topics. If you struggle to define a good partitioning strategy or wonder how to design a data model I can help you. In the past I worked on various projects:
        <ul class="resume-item-list">
            <li>Design and implementation of data ingestion and transformation pipelines</li>
            <li>Cloud-based data warehouse implementations</li>
            <li>Design and implementation of data driven services</li>
            <li>Workshops and knowledge transfer on cloud and data architecture, process design</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="resume-item-title" itemprop="name">Examples</h3>

        I work together with your team of engineers to cover your data engineering needs, e.g.:

        <ul class="resume-item-list">
            <li>Fetch data from a REST-API, transform it using AWS Glue and store the result on AWS S3</li>
            <li>Setup AWS Managed Airflow (MWAA) to schedule and manage various data pipelines</li>
            <li>Build complex data transformation jobs using Apache Spark on AWS EMR</li>
            <li>Develop and integrate an AWS Lambda function to transform data on upload</li>
            <li>Implement real-time analytics dashboard using AWS Kinesis and Spark Streaming</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="resume-item-title" itemprop="name">Approach</h3>


        My approach assessing a new project is as follows:
        <ol class="resume-item-list">
            <li class="resume-item-highlight">Define Project Objectives and Requirements:</li>
            <ul class="resume-item-list">
                <li>Clearly outline the project's objectives and what they aim to achieve with the data processing
                    pipeline. Understand the specific data sources, volume, variety, and velocity.
                </li>
                <li>Document the technical requirements, such as the need for real-time processing, batch processing,
                    data warehousing, analytics, and reporting.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li class="resume-item-highlight">Assess Data Sources:</li>
            <ul class="resume-item-list">
                <li>Evaluate the quality and accessibility of the data sources. Ensure that data is available, reliable,
                    and accessible through AWS services or connectors.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li class="resume-item-highlight">Cost Analysis:</li>
            <ul class="resume-item-list">
                <li>Estimate the costs associated with building and maintaining the data processing pipeline on AWS.
                    Consider factors such as infrastructure costs, data storage, data transfer, and AWS service charges.
                </li>
                <li>Provide a cost-benefit analysis to help understand the return on investment (ROI) and
                    potential cost savings compared to alternative solutions.

                <li>Assess the compatibility of AWS services with the startup's existing technology stack and
                    infrastructure.
